# Introduction

Welcome to the Game Center API! You can use our API to access Game Center API endpoints, which can get information on leaderboards.

We have language bindings in Shell and Java! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
