#TODO
- Update the endpoint so they arent all at the same URL.
- Change the Java code to match the client, when that's done.
- Factor out the imports in the example java code into the intro somewhere.
  Maybe do the same with cURL auth code with env vars?
- Separate GET params and POST params in examples. Possibly different tables in
  the description.
